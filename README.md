Morphological Processing & Texture Analysis

PROBLEM 1: MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSING
In this problem, you are given a binary image I (circle.raw) as shown in Fig. 1. Please follow the instructions below:
(a) Design a morphological process to extract the objectsâ€™ boundaries and output the result as an image M.
(b) Perform connected component labeling on I to obtain an image L where different objects are labeled with different colors.
(c) Please design an algorithm based on the morphological operators you learned in class to count the number of circles in image I. Please detail how you solve the
overlapping problem.
